# 📘 DSA Short Notes (Today’s Learning)

## 1. What is Time Complexity?

Time Complexity tells us **how fast our code runs** as input size (**n**) increases.
It helps us compare which solution is **faster and better**.

Example:

* One loop → O(n)
* Two nested loops → O(n²)

---

## 2. What is Space Complexity?

Space Complexity tells us **how much extra memory** our program uses.

* No extra variable/array → O(1)
* Array of size n → O(n)

---

## 3. Why Time & Space Complexity is Important?

* To write **efficient code**
* To handle **large data**
* Very important for **interviews**
* Helps you think like a **software engineer**

---

## 4. Big-O Basic Rules

* Ignore constants
* Focus on growth with **n**
* Worst-case is considered

Examples:

* O(2n), O(5n) → O(n)
* O(n + 10) → O(n)

---

## 5. Loop Patterns & Complexity

| Code Pattern        | Time Complexity |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| No loop             | O(1)            |
| Single loop         | O(n)            |
| Nested loops        | O(n²)           |
| Loop doubles/halves | O(log n)        |

---

## 6. What is O(log n)?

When value is **divided or multiplied** in each step.

Examples:

* `i = i * 2`
* `i = i * 3`
* `n = n / 2`

👉 Time Complexity = **O(log n)**
(Base does not matter)

---

## 7. Important Rule (Very Easy)

* **Multiply / Divide → log n**
* **Add / Subtract → n**

---

## 8. Ignore Constants Rule

* O(100) → O(1)
* O(3n) → O(n)
* O(n + 5) → O(n)
* Do NOT ignore powers like n²

---

## 9. Meaning of `^`

* In **Math / DSA explanation** → power (2³ = 8)
* In **Java** → XOR operator (not power)

Power in Java:

```java
Math.pow(2, 3)
```
